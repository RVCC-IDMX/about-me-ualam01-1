            <h2>Some Literary Work</h2>

            <div>
                <p>He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.
                    Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They
                    shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he
                    had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover,
                    Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they
                    had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general
                    similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.</p>

                <p>It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet’s mind gave a
                    glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and
                    smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her
                    approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing
                    else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly
                    showed how really happy he was.</p>

                <p>Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the
                    night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:</p>

                <p>“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”</p>

                <p>Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.</p>

                <p>“You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily
                    settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike.
                    You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant
                    will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income.”</p>
